ABSTRACT
Zero-day network interruption assaults comprise a regular online protection danger, as they look to take advantage of the
weaknesses of an organization framework. Zero-day attacks have always been a major contributor in data leaks which has led to
loss of money, time, and resources. Our solution to detect and prevent such attacks is a desktop application that monitors your
network traffic in real time and looks for any anomalies or malicious activity that may be happening and works to minimize the
damage caused by prevention. Our Zero-day attack detection and prevention system is a software designed to protect the user’s
machine from malicious connections and stop it if any are attempted. Our software utilizes a network flow collection tool called
CIC Flowmeter to collect network flows from the user in real time. These flows are analyzed using a two layer approach.
Protection is employed by blocking network port access for specific IP Addresses that have been flagged as malicious.

Keywords: Zero day attacks, Attack detection, Machine Learning.
1.Introduction
In today’s ever-changing world, networks
and digital systems have proliferated to every path of
life. It has revolutionized how we live and conduct
business, research and polity. However, growing with
the advantages of seamless connectivity is the threat
of mounting cyber attacks. With a large portion of our
public and private data being hosted on digital
technologies, protecting computer systems and
networks from malicious attacks has become a critical
concern in the current digital era. Cybercriminals,
leveraging the power of the internet, are constantly
searching for vulnerabilities in hardware and software
that can be exploited to steal or corrupt data. Within
the rapidly expanding cyber security landscape, the
complexity and scale of cyber attacks has grown
exponentially. Amongst these attacks the most
challenging to counter is the zero-day attack. A zeroday attack occurs when criminals exploit unknown
vulnerabilities in hardware or software, unbeknownst
to manufacturers. Akin to being caught unawares, this
means that there are no defenses or safeguards to
prevent these assaults. Zero-day attacks are
particularly tricky to deal with, as they catch
organizations off guard. This leaves developers with
little time to identify and mitigate the damage. If
undetected, this attack may inflict irreparable damage
to essential system architecture.
