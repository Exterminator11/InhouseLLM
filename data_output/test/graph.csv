zero-day network interruption attacks|cyber attacks|Cyber attacks, also known as zero-day attacks, comprise a regular online security threat that exploit the weaknesses of an organization's infrastructure. These types of attacks have been contributing significantly to data breaches resulting in losses of money, time, and resources.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
zero-day network interruption attacks|data leaks|Zero-day attacks are a major contributor to data leaks that have led to losses of money, time, and resources.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
zero-day network interruption attacks|prevention|Our solution to detect and prevent such attacks is a desktop application that monitors your network traffic in real time and looks for any anomalies or malicious activity that may be happening and works to minimize the damage caused by prevention.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
zero-day network interruption attacks|machine learning|Keywords: Zero day attacks, Attack detection, Machine Learning.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
protection|malicious connections|Our software utilizes a network flow collection tool called CIC Flowmeter to collect network flows from the user in real time. These flows are analyzed using a two layer approach. Protection is employed by blocking network port access for specific IP Addresses that have been flagged as malicious.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
cyber attacks|digital infrastructure|With a large portion of our public and private data being hosted on digital infrastructure, growing with the advantages of seamless connectivity is the threat of mounting cyber attacks.|d2c2552381744b1ea4bb62edbaa5dad9
zero-day attack|unknown vulnerabilities|occurs when criminals exploit unknown vulnerabilities in hardware or software, unbeknownst to manufacturers.|bdc68d203d3e4f73994b13d6d0221cd5
zero-day attack|no defenses or safeguards|leaves developers with little time to identify and mitigate the damage, as they catch organizations off guard.|bdc68d203d3e4f73994b13d6d0221cd5
zero-day attack|irreparable damage|if undetected, this attack may inflict irreparable damage to essential system architecture.|bdc68d203d3e4f73994b13d6d0221cd5
cyber attacks|vulnerabilities in hardware and software|protecting computer systems and networks from malicious attacks has become a critical concern in the current digital era, as cybercriminals, leveraging the power of the internet, are constantly searching for vulnerabilities in hardware and software that can be exploited to steal or corrupt data.|bdc68d203d3e4f73994b13d6d0221cd5
