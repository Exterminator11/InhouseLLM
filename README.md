# InhouseLLM

Developed an application designed to use Large Language Models (LLMs). All of this when the models are not connected to the internet.
This application boasts advanced capabilities in summarization and question answering. 
The models use a Knowledge Graph or GAG(Graph Augmented generation) approach that ensures efficient and cost-effective question answering by maintaining conciseness.
Optimized to handle large amounts of data.
The models are quantised to save memory and support on-device computing.
